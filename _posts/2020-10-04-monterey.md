I had a few requests to explain Pensando Systems involvement in VMware's project Monterey. This post is a collection of pointers.

Let's start with this video that was posted on the [2020 Next-Gen Infrastructure Acceleration Report](https://nextgeninfra.io/infrastructure-acceleration/).
It describes how Pensando Systems is working with VMware on Project Monterey to integrate the next generation SmartNIC technology into VMware.

This is a post on the Pensando blog that I coauthored with Christopher Ratcliffe. It is titled: ["Pensando, VMware and Project Monterey – Everything You Need to Know"](https://pensando.io/pensando-vmware-and-project-monterey/)

This is a post on the VMware website titled: ["Announcing Project Monterey – Redefining Hybrid Cloud Architecture"](https://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2020/09/announcing-project-monterey-redefining-hybrid-cloud-architecture.html)
