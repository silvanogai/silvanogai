excerpt: Scott Stevens explains the foundation of trust required for security implementations
description: A video on the foundation of trust in security with Scott Stevens

In today's video, I interview [Scott Stevens](https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-stevens-172b542/) as he explains a fundamental concept in security: **the foundation of trust**.

 Solutions like encryption, Zero Trust Networking, micro-segmentation, and protecting applications regardless of how they are hosted require a foundational and robust **Root of Trust (RoT)**.

Scott explains how Pensando supports a full RoT in the DSC (Distributed Services Card) by incorporating dedicated hardware like a **PUF (Physically Unclonable Function)** and secures it with a **HardGap (PCIe Firewall)**.

This RoT is fundamental to guarantee that the DSC runs only certified software and that all the encryption keys are adequately protected and cannot be harvested.

In case a workload is compromised, the HardGap limits lateral exposure since the compromised workload cannot access the security rules stored on the DSC.

I promise I will make more videos like this with more technical details.
