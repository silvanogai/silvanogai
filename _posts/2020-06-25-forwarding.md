Techniques and algorithms to forward packets have been a topic of discussion since the eighties. In this podcast, I chat with [Mario Baldi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mario-baldi/) about forwarding. Mario has also his own blog at [https://blog.baldi.info/](https://blog.baldi.info/)

We informally cover:
* Layer 2 vs. layer 3 forwarding
* ACLs processing
* Binary vs. ternary matches
* Binary hash table forwarding
* Ternary LPM (Longest Prefix Match) forwarding
* Combining forwarding with ACLs
* Flow cache based forwarding
* Forwarding in routers and NICs
* Label Forwarding
* Segment routing
