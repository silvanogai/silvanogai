[Jennifer English](https://www.techtarget.com/contributor/Jennifer-English) is senior site editor for SearchNetworking at [TechTarget](https://www.techtarget.com). She interviewed me, and we chatted about **How smartNIC architecture supports scalable infrastructure**.

This interview is posted [here](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/feature/How-smartNIC-architecture-supports-scalable-infrastructure).

With the occasion, TechTarget also published an excerpt from my book ['Building a Future-Proof Cloud Infrastructure'](https://www.informit.com/store/building-a-future-proof-cloud-infrastructure-a-unified-9780136624097?utm_source=pensando&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=bookad)) that looks at how smartNICs can support distributed services platforms for both cloud providers and enterprises.
